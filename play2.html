        <p class="speech Tartuffe">There, I swear, is an abominable man!<br>
            I can't get over it.  What is his plan?</p>

        <p class = "speech Elmire">How now?  Come out so soon?  Were you having fun?<br>
            Get back down there.  We've only just begun.<br>
            Wait till the end to be completely sure,<br>
            And don't put your faith in mere conjecture.</p>
        <h6 class = "name">Orgon</h6>  
        <p class = "speech Orgon">No man more evil has been spawned in Hell.<br>
            Elmire.  Dear Lord!  Don't believe the lies people tell.<br>
            Be wholly convinced before you concede:<br>
            Cautious men shun the slips that come with speed.</p>
